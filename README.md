# Project Title

LiveScore is a PHP application written in PhalconÂ which provides a live scoring system to a sporting competition, designed for Intervarsity Competitions. Lancaster is a collegiate university, and the majority of the colleges have competitions with multiple sports. Historically, no one has known the scores for each sport and subsequently the overall score.

## Getting Started

To install this, you'll need a web server running LAMP and Phalcon. Point your Directory to the Public area, and make sure the Compiled folder has write permissions by the user running your web server. Finally, you'll need to ensure that you've configured the config.php file correctly, using the correct database, an empty SQL structure can be found here.
